# Create Your Bot

:::danger IMPORTANT

This section is very important

:::  
## Step 1: Create a Discord Bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in with your Discord account.

2. Click on the "New Application" button and give your application a name. This name will be your bot's name, so choose something related to Music, like **Music Bot**.

## Step 2: Enable Privileged Gateway Intents

In order for your bot to work effectively with NoteSync, you need to enable the following Privileged Gateway Intents: **PRESENCE INTENT**, **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT**, and **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT**.

1. Enable **PRESENCE INTENT**:
   - Go to the **Bot** section in the Discord Developer Portal.
   - Toggle ON the **Presence Intent** option.

2. Enable **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT**:
   - In the same section, toggle ON the **Server Members Intent** option.

3. Enable **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT**:
   - In the same section, toggle ON the **Message Content Intent** option.

## Step 3: Add the Bot to Your Discord Server

1. Go back to the **General Information** tab in the Discord Developer Portal and copy your bot's Application ID. You'll need this to generate the invite link.

2. Generate an Invite Link:
   - Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` in the following URL with your bot's Client ID: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=2146958847

- Open this link in your web browser, choose your desired server, and grant the necessary permissions.

## Step 4: Retrieve the Bot Token

1. While still on the **Bot** section of the Discord Developer Portal, under the **Token** subsection, click on the **Copy** or **Reset** button to copy your bot's token. Keep this token safe and never share it publicly!

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You've now created a Discord bot and enabled the necessary Privileged Gateway Intents for NoteSync. In the next steps of your guide, you can proceed to integrate the bot with your Minecraft server. ðŸ˜„
